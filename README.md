# Review-Generator

Generates reviews using a Markov model.

This is a project where I took a massive amount of user reviews from Disneyland to create a markov model and used that markov model to generate reviews based on which star rating the user chooses

A markov moddel ended up not being the best option for this type of generation, but it was good practice, and can end up writing some funny stuff.
